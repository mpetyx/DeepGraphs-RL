This library is mainly based on rdflib work.
Mainly it extends the rdflib/OWL-RL and makes usage of rdflib/FUXI

Of course, none of this would be possible without the rdflib itself.

I also use this super awesome library https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontosPy that comes with a nice helpful article!
