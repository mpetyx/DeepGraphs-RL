# 0. make the caching of stuff more intelligent: the app consumes too much memory!

# 1. think of a better conceptual model for the code. EG Utils should all be split, ontospy reduced to a minimum etc...

# 2. # how to avoid "RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object"  - for big ontologies ? 

# 3. load an ontology from a sparql endpoint, by querying for all classes
	- add option of preloading onto info, or just do it in real time using SPARQL
	
# BUG: if the onto annotations have more than one value we're not returning all of them! 
eg check the GOLD ontology.....
